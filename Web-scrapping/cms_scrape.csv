Robert Baden-Powell,"One of the powerful temptations is that of the cinema palace.

,
Robert Baden-Powell,"It is often useful, if an enemy happens to see you, to pretend that you have not seen him. Or it may sometimes be useful to pretend that you have other men with you.

Yuvraj Singh,"Relationships survive on trust, and if that is broken at any point, it's pretty much the end of the relationship. Besides, inability to communicate leads to problems."

Yuvraj Singh,"Being the vice-captain, you see a lot of things on the field. You have to try and help the captain as much as you can and lead by example on the field. Small things like getting a run-out or taking a catch makes the other boys try and lift their standards. So yes, I do have an important role, even if I'm not captain."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I am a great movie buff, and I devour films regularly."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"The bad boy image is something given to me by the media. I have been in relationships earlier, even for as long as three years. I am not saying I am a saint. I am like any other guy, I guess. Unfortunately, every time I even meet a person, it is reported as a link-up."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"There were times when chemo would eat my body, but I told myself that I have the strength and courage to win and come out stronger."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I have worked really hard on my game, but I think my mother has been a real pillar of strength. She has prayed a lot, sacrificed a lot for me. You know, she hasn't seen me bat so far. When I am batting, she is praying... mothers are like that, aren't they?"
,
Yuvraj Singh,I want someone who will love me for the person I am and not because of my status. It has to be someone who understands the pressure of playing for India. It will be very difficult to be with a person who has her own career because someone has to make sacrifices for the family and house.
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Cricket is my life. Before the cancer, I was happy-go-lucky. I used to think about my career and worry about the future. But post it, my thinking has completely changed. I'm happy to eat and breathe normally. I'm happy to have my life back."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"When one is young, aspiring to play for the country, doing well, any hindrance, like injury or being out of form, can be frustrating and a cause of annoyance or even anger. But once you have a close encounter with death, you realise the real value of life."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"From a spectator point of view, Test cricket is not important; people hardly watch Test cricket. But as a player, Tests are the real thing. You have to concentrate for five days. It's a lot of time, and not easy to do it day in and day out. If people have played 70-100 Tests, it's a lot of cricket, a lot of concentration and dedication."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I cried like a baby. When no one could see me or hear me. Not because I feared what cancer would do, but because I didn't want the disease. I wanted my life to be normal, which it could no longer be."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Obviously, a lot of things play on your mind when you're batting. This might happen and this might not. The best thing you can do when you're batting is not to think too much, and wait for the next ball."
,
Yuvraj Singh,I have been accused of things that I have never done. I have been called a perpetrator of incidents while I was actually a peacemaker. I really don't know why. Yuvraj Singh isn't a party animal; he is just singled out. I don't know why.
,
Yuvraj Singh,"The battle against cancer has made me strong. It's like winning a war! When I was diagnosed, I was told by doctors my kidney, liver and other organs could fail. It was tough. I didn't know if I could save my life. But I was positive, and because of that, the doctor told me that I would be a man who would never have cancer."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"In sport, there is always room for improvement. Whenever I see my innings against the West Indies or Australia, I think, 'Maybe, I could have done this better or should have changed that.' See, cricket is a skill game, and one can always improve upon the impact one has on an innings."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Cancer has taught me a lot of things. Maybe it is the best thing that has happened to me. I can't say right now, but maybe some years down the line, I would realise. When I was taking chemotherapy, there were a lot of elderly patients, and that would inspire me. I thought, 'If they can be cured, why can't I be?'"
,
Yuvraj Singh,"When I was going through my chemotherapy, I realized not many people are willing to talk about cancer, even after getting fully cured. Celebrities and educated people are also very protective and private about it. I still haven't understood why. I decided to fight my battle out in the public."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"No matter what people say, about what I did, about what I am like... They say you are not dedicated or hardworking. A lot of people say things about me, but they don't realise I have played 250 games. It's not like you just land up in the team, sit down and play 250 games. You can't survive like that in international cricket."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I have stopped having goals. If you have many goals, and you don't reach your goals, it is very upsetting, so I just think of keeping it simple, working hard and going and playing the game. But I know there are going to be very important series for Indian cricket. I will just try my best to be in my fittest form."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"People who don't know me, how will they know what I am really like? They will only see me on the field, only see me in an advertisement. People who know what kind of a guy I am will tell you I'm a very open person."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"On the field, you have to be aggressive; you're thinking how to get the better of a situation. It's not that I don't laugh on the field. In fact, I think it's very important to laugh, especially when you are angry and aggressive, to just take the tension away, make the moment go away."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I have been in love, and it was a great feeling. It's when you are attracted to and feel affection for someone. You want to do things for that person. But only love isn't enough in a relationship - understanding and communication are very important aspects."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I'm past my wooing days now. See, I am an honest person. If I like a girl, I will go and tell her."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"When I was a kid, I used to try and hit every ball out of the ground. After playing one-day cricket and Test cricket, I never thought I'd get a chance to play like that again, ever. Twenty20 has given me the opportunity of playing like a kid again. I can just feel free and go out there and hit."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I will only think of settling down after Salman Khan, the other most eligible bachelor, plans to settle down. We are eligible bachelors, but he's the rock star, so let him get married first; then I'll think about myself."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I didn't believe when I was first told that I have cancer. I thought, 'How can a young person like me get cancer?' I thought it could never happen to me. It took me a while to realise that I was diagnosed with cancer."

Chamath Palihapitiya,"We curate our lives around this perceived sense of perfection, because we get rewarded in these short term signals: Hearts, likes, thumbs up.

Yuvraj Singh,"Relationships survive on trust, and if that is broken at any point, it's pretty much the end of the relationship. Besides, inability to communicate leads to problems."

Yuvraj Singh,"Being the vice-captain, you see a lot of things on the field. You have to try and help the captain as much as you can and lead by example on the field. Small things like getting a run-out or taking a catch makes the other boys try and lift their standards. So yes, I do have an important role, even if I'm not captain."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I am a great movie buff, and I devour films regularly."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"The bad boy image is something given to me by the media. I have been in relationships earlier, even for as long as three years. I am not saying I am a saint. I am like any other guy, I guess. Unfortunately, every time I even meet a person, it is reported as a link-up."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"There were times when chemo would eat my body, but I told myself that I have the strength and courage to win and come out stronger."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I have worked really hard on my game, but I think my mother has been a real pillar of strength. She has prayed a lot, sacrificed a lot for me. You know, she hasn't seen me bat so far. When I am batting, she is praying... mothers are like that, aren't they?"
,
Yuvraj Singh,I want someone who will love me for the person I am and not because of my status. It has to be someone who understands the pressure of playing for India. It will be very difficult to be with a person who has her own career because someone has to make sacrifices for the family and house.
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Cricket is my life. Before the cancer, I was happy-go-lucky. I used to think about my career and worry about the future. But post it, my thinking has completely changed. I'm happy to eat and breathe normally. I'm happy to have my life back."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"When one is young, aspiring to play for the country, doing well, any hindrance, like injury or being out of form, can be frustrating and a cause of annoyance or even anger. But once you have a close encounter with death, you realise the real value of life."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"From a spectator point of view, Test cricket is not important; people hardly watch Test cricket. But as a player, Tests are the real thing. You have to concentrate for five days. It's a lot of time, and not easy to do it day in and day out. If people have played 70-100 Tests, it's a lot of cricket, a lot of concentration and dedication."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I cried like a baby. When no one could see me or hear me. Not because I feared what cancer would do, but because I didn't want the disease. I wanted my life to be normal, which it could no longer be."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Obviously, a lot of things play on your mind when you're batting. This might happen and this might not. The best thing you can do when you're batting is not to think too much, and wait for the next ball."
,
Yuvraj Singh,I have been accused of things that I have never done. I have been called a perpetrator of incidents while I was actually a peacemaker. I really don't know why. Yuvraj Singh isn't a party animal; he is just singled out. I don't know why.
,
Yuvraj Singh,"The battle against cancer has made me strong. It's like winning a war! When I was diagnosed, I was told by doctors my kidney, liver and other organs could fail. It was tough. I didn't know if I could save my life. But I was positive, and because of that, the doctor told me that I would be a man who would never have cancer."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"In sport, there is always room for improvement. Whenever I see my innings against the West Indies or Australia, I think, 'Maybe, I could have done this better or should have changed that.' See, cricket is a skill game, and one can always improve upon the impact one has on an innings."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Cancer has taught me a lot of things. Maybe it is the best thing that has happened to me. I can't say right now, but maybe some years down the line, I would realise. When I was taking chemotherapy, there were a lot of elderly patients, and that would inspire me. I thought, 'If they can be cured, why can't I be?'"
,
Yuvraj Singh,"When I was going through my chemotherapy, I realized not many people are willing to talk about cancer, even after getting fully cured. Celebrities and educated people are also very protective and private about it. I still haven't understood why. I decided to fight my battle out in the public."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"No matter what people say, about what I did, about what I am like... They say you are not dedicated or hardworking. A lot of people say things about me, but they don't realise I have played 250 games. It's not like you just land up in the team, sit down and play 250 games. You can't survive like that in international cricket."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I have stopped having goals. If you have many goals, and you don't reach your goals, it is very upsetting, so I just think of keeping it simple, working hard and going and playing the game. But I know there are going to be very important series for Indian cricket. I will just try my best to be in my fittest form."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"People who don't know me, how will they know what I am really like? They will only see me on the field, only see me in an advertisement. People who know what kind of a guy I am will tell you I'm a very open person."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"On the field, you have to be aggressive; you're thinking how to get the better of a situation. It's not that I don't laugh on the field. In fact, I think it's very important to laugh, especially when you are angry and aggressive, to just take the tension away, make the moment go away."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I have been in love, and it was a great feeling. It's when you are attracted to and feel affection for someone. You want to do things for that person. But only love isn't enough in a relationship - understanding and communication are very important aspects."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I'm past my wooing days now. See, I am an honest person. If I like a girl, I will go and tell her."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"When I was a kid, I used to try and hit every ball out of the ground. After playing one-day cricket and Test cricket, I never thought I'd get a chance to play like that again, ever. Twenty20 has given me the opportunity of playing like a kid again. I can just feel free and go out there and hit."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I will only think of settling down after Salman Khan, the other most eligible bachelor, plans to settle down. We are eligible bachelors, but he's the rock star, so let him get married first; then I'll think about myself."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I didn't believe when I was first told that I have cancer. I thought, 'How can a young person like me get cancer?' I thought it could never happen to me. It took me a while to realise that I was diagnosed with cancer."

Chamath Palihapitiya,"We curate our lives around this perceived sense of perfection, because we get rewarded in these short term signals: Hearts, likes, thumbs up.

B. R. Ambedkar,The sovereignty of scriptures of all religions must come to an end if we want to have a united integrated modern India.

B. R. Ambedkar,"Indians today are governed by two different ideologies. Their political ideal set in the preamble of the Constitution affirms a life of liberty, equality and fraternity. Their social ideal embodied in their religion denies them."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"What are we having this liberty for? We are having this liberty in order to reform our social system, which is full of inequality, discrimination and other things, which conflict with our fundamental rights."

,
B. R. Ambedkar,Political tyranny is nothing compared to the social tyranny and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man than a politician who defies Government.
,
B. R. Ambedkar,A people and their religion must be judged by social standards based on social ethics. No other standard would have any meaning if religion is held to be necessary good for the well-being of the people.
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"An ideal society should be mobile, should be full of channels for conveying a change taking place in one part to other parts. In an ideal society, there should be many interests consciously communicated and shared."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words: liberty, equality and fraternity. Let no one, however, say that I have borrowed by philosophy from the French Revolution. I have not. My philosophy has roots in religion and not in political science. I have derived them from the teachings of my Master, the Buddha."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,I solemnly assure you that I will not die as a Hindu.
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"That the caste system must be abolished if the Hindu society is to be reconstructed on the basis of equality, goes without saying. Untouchability has its roots in the caste system. They cannot expect the Brahmins to rise in revolt against the caste system. Also we cannot rely upon the non-Brahmins and ask them to fight our battle."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,There is one taboo against meat-eating. It divides Hindus into vegetarians and flesh eaters. There is another taboo which is against beef eating. It divides Hindus into those who eat cow's flesh and those who do not.
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"To my mind, there is no doubt that this Gandhi age is the dark age of India. It is an age in which people, instead of looking for their ideals in the future, are returning to antiquity."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"Some men say that they should be satisfied with the abolition of untouchability only, leaving the caste system alone. The aim of abolition of untouchability alone without trying to abolish the inequalities inherent in the caste system is a rather low aim."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"The Touchables, whether they are vegetarians or flesh-eaters, are united in their objection to eat cow's flesh. As against them stand the Untouchables, who eat cow's flesh without compunction and as a matter of course and habit."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"People are not wrong in observing Caste. In my view, what is wrong is their religion, which has inculcated this notion of Caste. If this is correct, then obviously the enemy, you must grapple with is not the people who observe Caste, but the Shastras which teach them this religion of Caste."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"No Hindu community, however low, will touch cow's flesh. On the other hand, there is no community which is really an Untouchable community which has not something to do with the dead cow. Some eat her flesh, some remove the skin, some manufacture articles out of her skin and bones."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"Generally speaking, the Smritikars never care to explain the why and the how of their dogmas."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"Indeed, the Muslims have all the social evils of the Hindus and something more. That something more is the compulsory system of purdah for Muslim women. These burka women walking in the streets is one of the most hideous sights one can witness in India."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"Why is it that a large majority of Hindus do not inter-dine and do not inter-marry? Why is it that your cause is not popular? There can be only one answer to this question, and it is that inter-dining and inter-marriage are repugnant to the beliefs and dogmas which the Hindus regard as sacred."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"Caste may be bad. Caste may lead to conduct so gross as to be called man's inhumanity to man. All the same, it must be recognized that the Hindus observe Caste not because they are inhuman or wrong-headed. They observe Caste because they are deeply religious."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"One can quite understand vegetarianism. One can quite understand meat-eating. But it is difficult to understand why a person who is a flesh-eater should object to one kind of flesh, namely cow's flesh. This is an anomaly which call for explanation."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"The reason why Broken Men only became Untouchables was because in addition to being Buddhists, they retained their habit of beef-eating, which gave additional ground for offence to the Brahmins to carry their new-found love and reverence to the cow to its logical conclusion."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,That the object of the Brahmins in giving up beef-eating was to snatch away from the Buddhist Bhikshus the supremacy they had acquired is evidenced by the adoption of vegetarianism by Brahmins.
,
B. R. Ambedkar,"The food habits of the different classes of Hindus have been as fixed and stratified as their cults. Just as Hindus can be classified on their basis of their cults, so also they can be classified on the basis of their habits of food."
,
B. R. Ambedkar,Some people think that religion is not essential to society. I do not hold this view. I consider the foundation of religion to be essential to the life and practices of a society.

No matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you can make it. That's an essential promise of America. Where you start should not determine where you end up."
,
Barack Obama,"We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense."

,
Barack Obama,"My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too."
,
Barack Obama,If the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
,
Barack Obama,"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage. But when you start playing around with constitutions, just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person, it just seems to me that's not what America's about. Usually, our constitutions expand liberties, they don't contract them."

Barack Obama,"

"
,
Barack Obama,"Money is not the only answer, but it makes a difference."
,
Barack Obama,"We need to keep making our streets safer and our criminal justice system fairer - our homeland more secure, our world more peaceful and sustainable for the next generation."
,
Barack Obama,"We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded."
,
Barack Obama,I've got a pen and I've got a phone - and I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward.
,
Barack Obama,Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.
,
Barack Obama,"

"
,
Barack Obama,Issues are never simple. One thing I'm proud of is that very rarely will you hear me simplify the issues.
,
Barack Obama,"Understand, our police officers put their lives on the line for us every single day. They've got a tough job to do to maintain public safety and hold accountable those who break the law."
,
Barack Obama,"We need to steer clear of this poverty of ambition, where people want to drive fancy cars and wear nice clothes and live in nice apartments but don't want to work hard to accomplish these things. Everyone should try to realize their full potential."
,
Barack Obama,This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet. Let us resolve that we will not leave our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands.

,
Barack Obama,We need to internalize this idea of excellence. Not many folks spend a lot of time trying to be excellent.
,
Barack Obama,"It's not surprising, then, they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations."
,
Barack Obama,"When we think of the major threats to our national security, the first to come to mind are nuclear proliferation, rogue states and global terrorism. But another kind of threat lurks beyond our shores, one from nature, not humans - an avian flu pandemic."
,
Barack Obama,"You know, my faith is one that admits some doubt."
,

,
Barack Obama,"I've got two daughters. 9 years old and 6 years old. I am going to teach them first of all about values and morals. But if they make a mistake, I don't want them punished with a baby."

,
Barack Obama,We can't drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times... and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK. That's not leadership. That's not going to happen.

Barack Obama,"Take off your bedroom slippers. Put on your marching shoes,' he said, his voice rising as applause and cheers mounted. 'Shake it off. Stop complainin'. Stop grumblin'. Stop cryin'. We are going to press on. We have work to do."
,
Barack Obama,"A good compromise, a good piece of legislation, is like a good sentence; or a good piece of music. Everybody can recognize it. They say, 'Huh. It works. It makes sense.'"
,
Barack Obama,"We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States."
,
Barack Obama,We proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things and tackling our biggest challenges.
,
Barack Obama,"It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century, we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient, more transparent, and more creative. That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent."
,
Barack Obama,I think when you spread the wealth around it's good for everybody.
,
Barack Obama,"It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, family leave, health insurance, Social Security, Medicare, retirement plans. The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label."
,
Barack Obama,I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States.
,
Barack Obama,"In a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power - including strong and principled diplomacy."
,
Barack Obama,"Today we are engaged in a deadly global struggle for those who would intimidate, torture, and murder people for exercising the most basic freedoms. If we are to win this struggle and spread those freedoms, we must keep our own moral compass pointed in a true direction."
,
Barack Obama,Americans... still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.
,
Barack Obama,"Where the stakes are the highest, in the war on terror, we cannot possibly succeed without extraordinary international cooperation. Effective international police actions require the highest degree of intelligence sharing, planning and collaborative enforcement."
,
Barack Obama,"I mean, I do think at a certain point you've made enough money."
,
Barack Obama,"What I'm asking for is hard. It's easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn't possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future."
,
Barack Obama,"If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help... Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."
,
Barack Obama,I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war.
,
Barack Obama,"But what we can do, as flawed as we are, is still see God in other people, and do our best to help them find their own grace. That's what I strive to do, that's what I pray to do every day."
,
Barack Obama,"My job is not to represent Washington to you, but to represent you to Washington."
,
Barack Obama,We all remember Abraham Lincoln as the leader who saved our Union. Founder of the Republican Party.
,
Barack Obama,"This is the moment when we must build on the wealth that open markets have created, and share its benefits more equitably. Trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global development. But we will not be able to sustain this growth if it favors the few, and not the many."
,
Barack Obama,"I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together: black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance under the same proud flag to this big, bold country that we love. That's what I see. That's the America I know!"
,
Barack Obama,We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.
,
Barack Obama,"I miss Saturday morning, rolling out of bed, not shaving, getting into my car with my girls, driving to the supermarket, squeezing the fruit, getting my car washed, taking walks."
,
Barack Obama,"We need somebody who's got the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom, the empathy to understand what it's like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old - and that's the criterion by which I'll be selecting my judges."
,
Barack Obama,"No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy - well, you do the math. I refuse to go along with that. And as long as I'm President, I never will."
,
Barack Obama,There's not a liberal America and a conservative America - there's the United States of America.
,
Barack Obama,"To avoid being mistaken for a sellout, I chose my friends carefully. The more politically active black students. The foreign students. The Chicanos. The Marxist professors and structural feminists and punk-rock performance poets."

Billie Eilish,"

"
,
Billie Eilish,I've always done whatever I want and always been exactly who I am.
,
Billie Eilish,"In the public eye, girls and women with strong perspectives are hated. If you're a girl with an opinion, people just hate you. There are still people who are afraid of successful women, and that's so lame."
,
Billie Eilish,I hate smiling. It makes me feel weak and powerless and small. I've always been like that; I don't smile in any pictures.
,
Billie Eilish,It's rare for anyone to value the opinions of a teenage girl.
,
Billie Eilish,There are alway going to be bad things. But you can write it down and make a song out of it.
,
Billie Eilish,"In real life, I'm a really smiley person. I smile when I talk and I laugh."
,
Billie Eilish,"When I do have free time, I spend it with friends, or I spend it at home writing or making something."
,
Billie Eilish,"I really love Linkin Park, and I loved Chester Bennington, and it is horrible what happened to him. I grew up listening to him because my dad would make these mixtapes with a lot of different artists - Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne, The Beatles, Sarah McLachlan, I just really loved Linkin Park, and their production is really sick."
,
Billie Eilish,"If I'm in a bad mood, or if I'm uncomfortable, it's probably what I'm wearing that's making me feel that way."
,
Billie Eilish,"Words are more powerful than some noises. Noises won't last long. Lyrics are so important, and people don't realise that."
,
Billie Eilish,I like to be in control of how I look and how I feel and how I act.
,
Billie Eilish,It's really fun to put yourself into a character - into shoes you wouldn't normally be in.
,
Billie Eilish,"I go through a lot of depression, and I know other people do, too, but I have an outlet that so many people don't. If you have that inside of you and can't get it out, what do you do?"
,
Billie Eilish,Time is kind of an amazing thing because you can do so much with it. I think people underestimate time... I don't want to just sit on my phone for hours.
,
Billie Eilish,"I'm gonna make what I want to make, and other people are gonna like what they're gonna like. It doesn't really matter."
,
Billie Eilish,I'm a really particular person. I want it my way.
,
Billie Eilish,"I'm not going to say I'm cool, because I don't really feel that. I just don't care at all, and I guess that's what people think is cool."
,
Billie Eilish,"You can write a song about being in love with someone, but you don't have to be in love with anyone."
,
Billie Eilish,"I don't know how to function without music. When I'm not making it, I'm listening to it. It gives me courage and takes care of my mind."
,
Billie Eilish,"I really wanted to be a model when I was little. I loved photography, and I loved being on camera. But I was short and chubby, so I couldn't. Anyway, being an artist is way more interesting than just being a model because it's about you and what you want to be. You're not being treated like a clothes hanger."
,
Billie Eilish,"People are terrified of me, and I want them to be."
,
Billie Eilish,"When I was four, I wrote a song about falling into a black hole."
,
Billie Eilish,I love people talking about me; I love anybody just looking at me.
,
Billie Eilish,"Clothing & fashion are kind of my security blanket, almost."
,
Billie Eilish,"Nothing really scares me, to be honest."
,
Billie Eilish,"I don't really get nervous that much, or if I do, only I know. It's all inside me. I am good at hiding everything."
,
Billie Eilish,Smiling makes me feel weak and not in control and not powerful and small.
,
Billie Eilish,"I always want to create and do things, or draw."
,
Billie Eilish,"I think everybody deserves an equal amount of appreciation whether how old they are, but I mean, I'm cool with the praise. I'm good."
,
Billie Eilish,"Sexism is everywhere, bro. I don't know if it's ever not somewhere."
,
Billie Eilish,"My brother had written 'Ocean Eyes,' and we recorded it, basing all of the production around contemporary and lyrical dance. I think of most songs that way - if you can't dance to a song, it's not a song."
,
Billie Eilish,I feel like I might be a designer or stylist - or a director because I have always been super interested in cameras and editing.
,
Billie Eilish,"I don't even call them fans. I don't like that. They're literally just a part of my life; they're a part of my family. I don't think of them as on a lower level than me. I don't think I'm anything but equal to all of them. So yeah, they're basically all of my siblings."
,
Billie Eilish,"If I make music and people hate it, you know, whatever. I'll die someday, and one day, they will too."
,
Billie Eilish,I've been in the Los Angeles Children's Chorus since I was 8.
,
Billie Eilish,"I've always liked being busy. If I have nothing to do for a week, it just makes me mad."
,
Billie Eilish,"I always wanted to be a Vine star. I wasn't, thank God."
,
Billie Eilish,"I feel like I write so that people can think of it as theirs. If my song is exactly about your life right now, then it is - I don't even want to say that it's mine, because it's yours."
,
Billie Eilish,I hate the idea of genres.
,
Billie Eilish,"I work with my brother Finneas, and he produces all of my music in his little bedroom in our house. We actually tried renting out a studio for a month when we were producing 'Don't Smile at Me,' but it was really hard there, and we ended up just doing it at home anyway."
,
Billie Eilish,"I listen to music all day every day. I can't not listen to music. It's kind of scary how much I listen to music, but it's what I love, and it's all I care about, so I'm good with it."
,
Billie Eilish,"I'm trying to show everybody that I'm a girl, and I'm five foot four, and you can do anything you want, no matter your gender. It's your world, too!"
,
Billie Eilish,"All of the Vines that were acted & setup & had nice cameras, those weren't the good Vines. The good Vines were, like, a random little kid in the middle of a forest, like, yelling."
,
Billie Eilish,"I play piano and ukulele, and I taught myself those things just because I wanted to play them."
,
Billie Eilish,"Lyrics are so important, but they're really underrated."
,
Billie Eilish,"People think you have to go through something to write about it, and you absolutely do not. You can write about, like, a shoe. It's a story."
,
Billie Eilish,"People have so much going on in their heads. I'm like, If you could write a song, you'd feel so much better!"
,
Billie Eilish,"If it's good music, it's good music."
,
Billie Eilish,Writing music is just like writing a book.
,
Billie Eilish,"I find a lot of inspiration through visuals. When I was 12, I saw Aurora's 'Runaway' music video. Something inside me clicked, like, 'That is what I want to do, no matter whether it goes anywhere or not.'"
,
Billie Eilish,I always wear the kind of stuff that makes you overheat and die.
,
Billie Eilish,"Pretty much my whole life, I've been a performer and have loved singing and writing songs in my room for my own ears."
,
Billie Eilish,What makes a song last is real content from a mind that is thinking a little bit harder about certain things. A lot of artists don't really think that hard.
,
Billie Eilish,"I felt like, for so many years - and I still even feel it - as a girl, you can't really expect to go on stage and dress like a boy and jump around and scream with the audience and mosh and stuff, and every time that happens, I feel really proud."
,
Billie Eilish,"I had a period in my life where I decided that I would never be bored again and that, if I had any free time at all, I would make plans, and I would always be doing things. It actually was great for a year or so, but then I lost all of my friends."
,
Billie Eilish,"I wrote my first song at 12 and remember someone asking, 'What were you going through at 12 that you could write about?' I get what you're saying, but 11, 12, 13 were the hardest years of my life. You learn everything. You learn how horrible things feel."
,
Billie Eilish,I've always been a singer. I never really decided I was gonna be a singer. It just kind of - I just sung a lot.
,
Billie Eilish,"If you write in the same way over and over again, like, in the same place with the same techniques and with the same people, you're sort of writing the same song over and over again."
,
Billie Eilish,"My whole life, I've sung and listened to music, and since the beginning, I've had iTunes and used Apple Music for streaming."
,
Billie Eilish,"I'm pretty sure I don't have any songs that are about how much I love someone. They're all either about, like, 'I hate you,' or 'You make me hate me.'"

,
Bo Jackson,I would say my greatest achievement in life right now - my greatest achievement period is - and I'm still trying to achieve it - is to be a wonderful father to my kids.
,
Bo Jackson,I guarantee you that's what Jeff Gordon does. He uses everything the fans throw at him to stoke his fire and it drives him to be better at what he does.
,
Bo Jackson,"Being the 8th out of 10 kids, and being the one that stayed in trouble, I sort of became a momma's boy."
,
Bo Jackson,"Back before I injured my hip, I thought going to the gym was for wimps."
,
Bo Jackson,"I hate to blow my own horn, but I gave a lot of people fits."
,
Bo Jackson,"First of all, I really never imagined myself being a professional athlete."
,
Bo Jackson,My favorite driver is always either the bad guy or the underdog.
,
Bo Jackson,"I was a pitcher, shortstop and outfielder, and the Yankees tried to sign me out of high school as a first-round draft pick in 1981. I turned them down to go to college."
,
Bo Jackson,"In baseball, I was a pitcher, which I hated because there was no action there."
,
Bo Jackson,"I also tell them that your education can take you way farther than a football, baseball, track, or basketball will - that's just the bottom line."
,
Bo Jackson,I always wanted to be a pilot.
,
Bo Jackson,I was always active - I went from baseball to football. I didn't have time to work out.
,
Bo Jackson,"So, I got a lot of recruitment letters from track."
,
Bo Jackson,"My workout was running down fly balls, stealing a base, or running for my life on the football field."
,
Bo Jackson,"But now in this day and age, people are more prone to go out to try new things to enhance their performance on the field - to enhance their physical appearance."
,
Bo Jackson,"I have no problem with my hips - I can still do the things that I used to do. I can run, I'm just not the fastest person on the field anymore."
,
Bo Jackson,So you have to be more mentally focused in baseball.
,
Bo Jackson,"I've always played with kids that were five, six, seven years older than me."
,
Bo Jackson,"I've taken up golf in the past five or six years, and most of the time there aren't too many people out there that can drive a ball further than I can."
,
Bo Jackson,"I have been a fan all my life, but now I have been out of football for over 10 years, and out of baseball for a little over six years and I don't go to games."
,
Bo Jackson,I was the type of guy that used to get up in the morning and go out and just out run everybody on the field without stretching or warming up or anything.
,
Bo Jackson,I love going out and doing new things.
,
Bo Jackson,It occurred to me in my junior year of high school. I got my first letter from a big college. I still have that letter to this day - a letter from Indiana.
,
Bo Jackson,"Really, it's not harder to train for them because once baseball starts you play everyday almost."
,
Bo Jackson,"If you have four years to complete your college education, do it."
,
Bo Jackson,"So, baseball is probably more physical of the two mentally."
,
Bo Jackson,"Whenever I wasn't watching the planes, I was playing community baseball, football, or something like that."
,
Bo Jackson,You have a lot of people on the run and really don't have time to sit down and eat a balanced meal.

,
Charles R. Swindoll,"When you have a sense of calling, whether it's to be a musician, soloist, artist, in one of the technical fields, or a plumber, there is something deep and enriching when you realize it isn't just a casual choice, it's a divine calling.

,
Charles R. Swindoll,"If I ever wrote a book on preaching, it would contain three words: Preach the Word. Get rid of all the other stuff that gets you sidetracked; preach the Word."
,
Charles R. Swindoll,"I'm not against screens, or new songs, or innovation. I just don't like the gimmicks. I want to know when worship is over that that leader's sole purpose was to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ."
,
Charles R. Swindoll,I am often the brunt of my own humor.
,
Charles R. Swindoll,"When a church is spending more of its budget on media than shepherding, something is out of whack. We have gotten things twisted around."
,
Charles R. Swindoll,I want to preach till the last breath in my lungs runs out.
,
Charles R. Swindoll,"I am a preacher. I'm involved in many other things, but, mainly, I preach. And I love it!"

Jasprit Bumrah,You never know: anything can happen on any day.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,I don't focus on what the experts are saying or not.

Jasprit Bumrah,"It's always better for the bowlers to stick to a line and length, and that helps you get wickets."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"I love bowling and could bowl, bowl, and bowl."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,Bowlers have to adapt all the time.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"Earlier, I only used to get the ball into right handers. Over the years, I have developed some variations, thanks to first-class cricket and IPL."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"Nowadays, with technology coming into cricket, people start to analyse, and if you only have one or two tricks, people will start to line you up."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"It is always good to have a break. Whenever you return from the break, the hunger is back, the body is fresh, you are up and running in good spirit."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"Confidence is not dented after one match. If it happens, then you don't deserve to play."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,You can't be taking every opinion seriously.
,

Jasprit Bumrah,My focus is to always enjoy and bowl good lines and lengths.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"Every year, I learn something new at the IPL. It has shaped me as a cricketer."

Jasprit Bumrah,England has the flattest wickets.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,Lasith Malinga has been a great influence for me to bowl yorkers consistently.

,
Jasprit Bumrah,"When I made my First-Class debut, my first spell was of 10 overs. So I was always used to bowling lot of overs in Ranji Trophy, which always helps."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,You don't get anything easy. You have to work for it.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,You can't wicket 5-6 wickets every session.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,Learn from the mistake you made and go forward.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,There is not a single cricketer who has not made a mistake.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"As a bowler, my motto is not to get too excited and not to get too down after every match."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,It feels good that the captain has so much of confidence in you that he gives you freedom to do whatever you want.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,It's always good when you got competition in the team.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,I don't think I have a reputation to live up to and that I need to do things to satisfy that.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,I plan and I back myself in whichever situation I'm bowling.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"On a good day, when you have a clear plan, you are able to execute whatever you wanted."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,It was always a dream to play Test cricket and get a first five-wicket haul over here.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"If I say I don't believe in myself, who else will?"
,
Jasprit Bumrah,I just try to back myself in any situation that I go.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"If I am not able to execute my plans, then I feel I am not up to the mark and there has been a mistake on my part. Then I try to keep a cool head and try to do it all over again."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"Dot balls help build pressure, so even if you are not getting wickets, somebody from the other end is getting wickets, and the job is done."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"I always try and emphasize on having specific net sessions on 'death bowling.' It is similar to length balls - the more you practice, the better you get at it."
,
Jasprit Bumrah,It is very important for long tours to enjoy the country and see the places.
,
Jasprit Bumrah,"I always loved Test cricket, and I rate it very highly."

Jiddu Krishnamurti,It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.

Jiddu Krishnamurti,"In oneself lies the whole world and if you know how to look and learn, the door is there and the key is in your hand. Nobody on earth can give you either the key or the door to open, except yourself."

Jiddu Krishnamurti,"There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

"
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Life is relationship, living is relationship. We cannot live if you and I have built a wall around ourselves and just peep over that wall occasionally. Unconsciously, deeply, under the wall, we are related."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"The moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth, the delight, the ecstasy of it, you will discover that for you the world is transformed."

Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

"
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,One is never afraid of the unknown; one is afraid of the known coming to an end.

Jiddu Krishnamurti,"We all want to be famous people, and the moment we want to be something we are no longer free."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"If you begin to understand what you are without trying to change it, then what you are undergoes a transformation."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"What is needed, rather than running away or controlling or suppressing or any other resistance, is understanding fear; that means, watch it, learn about it, come directly into contact with it. We are to learn about fear, not how to escape from it."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

"
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,The constant assertion of belief is an indication of fear.
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"We are second-hand people. We have lived on what we have been told, either guided by our inclinations, our tendencies, or compelled to accept by circumstances and environment. We are the result of all kinds of influences, and there is nothing new in us, nothing that we have discovered for ourselves: nothing original, pristine, clear."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing and dance, and write poems and suffer and understand, for all that is life."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,Freedom from the desire for an answer is essential to the understanding of a problem.
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"A man who is not afraid is not aggressive, a man who has no sense of fear of any kind is really a free, a peaceful man."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"We never look deeply into the quality of a tree; we never really touch it, feel its solidity, its rough bark, and hear the sound that is part of the tree. Not the sound of wind through the leaves, not the breeze of a morning that flutters the leaves, but its own sound, the sound of the trunk and the silent sound of the roots."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"All ideologies are idiotic, whether religious or political, for it is conceptual thinking, the conceptual word, which has so unfortunately divided man."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"No one can live without relationship. You may withdraw into the mountains, become a monk, a sannyasi, wander off into the desert by yourself, but you are related. You cannot escape from that absolute fact. You cannot exist in isolation."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"A consistent thinker is a thoughtless person, because he conforms to a pattern; he repeats phrases and thinks in a groove."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"So when you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Die to everything of yesterday so that your mind is always fresh, always young, innocent, full of vigor and passion."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"When you draw or paint a tree, you do not imitate the tree; you do not copy it exactly as it is, which would be mere photography. To be free to paint a tree or a flower or a sunset, you have to feel what it conveys to you: the significance, the meaning of it."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong, but just to watch it and move with it. In that watching, you begin to understand the whole movement of thought and feeling. And out of this awareness comes silence."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Have you not noticed that love is silence? It may be while holding the hand of another, or looking lovingly at a child, or taking in the beauty of an evening. Love has no past or future, and so it is with this extraordinary state of silence."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Love is the missing factor; there is a lack of affection, of warmth in relationship; and because we lack that love, that tenderness, that generosity, that mercy in relationship, we escape into mass action, which produces further confusion, further misery."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"When I understand myself, I understand you, and out of that understanding comes love."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"The end is the beginning of all things, Suppressed and hidden, Awaiting to be released through the rhythm Of pain and pleasure."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"In seeking comfort, we generally find a quiet corner in life where there is a minimum of conflict, and then we are afraid to step out of that seclusion."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"If we depend for our happiness on another, on society or on environment, they become essential to us; we cling to them, and any alteration of these we violently oppose because we depend upon them for our psychological security and comfort."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"It is really very important while you are young to live in an environment in which there is no fear. Most of us, as we grow older, become frightened; we are afraid of living, afraid of losing a job, afraid of tradition, afraid of what the neighbours, or what the wife or husband would say, afraid of death."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"It is odd that we have so little relationship with nature, with the insects and the leaping frog and the owl that hoots among the hills calling for its mate. We never seem to have a feeling for all living things on the earth."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"The question of whether or not there is a God or truth or reality or whatever you like to call it, can never be answered by books, by priests, philosopher's or saviours. Nobody and nothing can answer the question but you yourself, and that is why you must know yourself - Immaturity lies only in total ignorance of self."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"With increasing age, dullness of mind and heart sets in."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"To live is to find out for yourself what is true, and you can do this only when there is freedom, when there is continuous revolution inwardly, within yourself."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"If we could establish a deep abiding relationship with nature, we would never kill an animal for our appetite; we would never harm, vivisect, a monkey, a dog, a guinea pig for our benefit. We would find other ways to heal our wounds, heal our bodies."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Can the mind see the truth of its own incapacity to know the unknown? Surely if I see very clearly that my mind cannot know the unknown, there is absolute quietness."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"We are domesticated animals, revolving in a cage which we have built for ourselves - with its contentions, wranglings, its impossible political leaders, its gurus who exploit our self-conceit and their own with great refinement or rather crudely."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"When one travels around the world, one notices to what an extraordinary degree human nature is the same, whether in India or America, in Europe or Australia."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

"
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,Religion is the frozen thought of man out of which they build temples.
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"When we talk about understanding, surely it takes place only when the mind listens completely - the mind being your heart, your nerves, your ears - when you give your whole attention to it."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"We do not know what love is. We know the symptoms of it, the pleasure, the pain, the fear, the anxiety and so on. We try to solve the symptoms, which becomes a wandering in darkness. We spend our days and nights in this, and it is soon over in death."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"It is violence when we use a sharp word, when we make a gesture to brush away a person. So violence isn't merely organized butchery in the name of God, in the name of society or country. Violence is much more subtle, much deeper."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"When the mind is empty, silent, when it is in a state of complete negation - which is not blankness, nor the opposite of being positive, but a totally different state in which all thought has ceased - only then is it possible for that which is unnameable to come into being."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Have you ever asked yourselves what you are going to do when you grow up? In all likelihood you will get married, and before you know where you are, you will be mothers and fathers; and you will then be tied to a job, or to the kitchen, in which you will gradually wither away. Is that all that your life is going to be?"
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,Listening has importance only when one is not projecting one's own desires through which one listens.
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,This is love: the flowering of love is meditation.
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"For most of us, relationship with another is based on dependence, either economic or psychological. This dependence creates fear, breeds in us possessiveness, results in friction, suspicion, frustration."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Organized murder is war, and though we demonstrate against a particular war, the nuclear, or any other kind of war, we have never demonstrated against war."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"If you have fear, you are bound by tradition, you follow some leader or guru. When you are bound by tradition, when you are afraid of your husband or your wife, you lose your dignity as an individual human being."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"In this constant battle which we call living, we try to set a code of conduct according to the society in which we are brought up, whether it be a Communist society or a so-called free society; we accept a standard of behaviour as part of our tradition as Hindus or Muslims or Christians or whatever we happen to be."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Truth cannot be brought down; rather, the individual must make the effort to ascend to it. You cannot bring the mountaintop to the valley. If you would attain to the mountaintop, you must pass through the valley, climb the steeps, unafraid of the dangerous precipices."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path. If you first understand that, then you will see how impossible it is to organize a belief."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention, totally, not just parts of it. And no one can teach you how to be attentive. If any system teaches you how to be attentive, then you are attentive to the system, and that is not attention."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,Truth is a pathless land.
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must not organize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallized; it becomes a creed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"You may be able to read Bernard Shaw's plays, you may be able to quote Shakespeare or Voltaire or some new philosopher; but if you in yourself are not intelligent, if you are not creative, what is the point of this education?"
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"Life cannot be without relationship, but we have made it so agonizing and hideous by basing it on personal and possessive love. Can one love and yet not possess? You will find the true answer not in escape, ideals, beliefs but through the understanding of the causes of dependence and possessiveness."
,
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"If one has fear, there can be no initiative in the creative sense of the word. To have initiative in this sense is to do something original - to do it spontaneously, naturally, without being guided, forced, controlled. It is to do something which you love to do."

John Updike,"Mars has long exerted a pull on the human imagination. The erratically moving red star in the sky was seen as sinister or violent by the ancients: The Greeks identified it with Ares, the god of war; the Babylonians named it after Nergal, god of the underworld.

John Updike,"My last vivid boyhood fright from books came when I was 15; I was visiting my uncle and aunt in Greenwich, and, emboldened by my success with 'The Waste Land,' I opened their copy of 'Ulysses.' The whiff of death off those remorseless, closely written pages overpowered me. So: back to soluble mysteries, and jokes that were not cosmic."

,
Jordan Peterson,Accept the terrible responsibility of life with eyes wide open.

Jordan Peterson,Don't compare yourself with other people; compare yourself with who you were yesterday.
,
Jordan Peterson,"The truth is something that burns. It burns off dead wood. And people don't like having the dead wood burnt off, often because they're 95 percent dead wood."
,
Jordan Peterson,"I don't tell people, 'You're okay the way that you are.' That's not the right story. The right story is, 'You're way less than you could be.'"

Jordan Peterson,"Don't lie about anything, ever. Lying leads to Hell."

Jordan Peterson,"If you don't stand your ground, then all that happens is people push you backwards."
,
Jordan Peterson,It is more difficult to rule yourself than to rule a city.
,
Jordan Peterson,"Adopt responsibility for your own well-being, try to put your family together, try to serve your community, try to seek for eternal truth... That's the sort of thing that can ground you in your life, enough so that you can withstand the difficulty of life."
,
Jordan Peterson,"The connection between psychology, mythology, and literature is as important as the connection between psychology and biology and the hard sciences."
,
Jordan Peterson,It's in responsibility that most people find the meaning that sustains them through life. It's not in happiness. It's not in impulsive pleasure.
,
Jordan Peterson,There's a personality trait known as agreeableness. Agreeable people are compassionate and polite. And agreeable people get paid less than disagreeable people for the same job. Women are more agreeable than men.
,
Jordan Peterson,"The people who hold that our culture is an oppressive patriarchy, they don't want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence."

Jordan Peterson,It's very hard to find your own words - and you don't actually exist until you have your own words.

Jordan Peterson,"

"
,
Jordan Peterson,Don't be dependent. At all. Ever. Period.
,
Jordan Peterson,"When you start to realise how much of what you've constructed of yourself is based on deception and lies, that is a horrifying realisation."
,
Jordan Peterson,"Part of the core information that I've been purveying is that identity politics is a sick game. You don't play racial, ethnic, and gender identity games. The Left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the Right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride. I think they're equally dangerous."
,
Jordan Peterson,"No one gets away with anything, ever, so take responsibility for your own life."
,
Jordan Peterson,Women deeply want men who are competent and powerful. And I don't mean power in that they can exert tyrannical control over others. That's not power. That's just corruption.

Jordan Peterson,I've studied authoritarianism for a very long time - for 40 years - and they're started by people's attempts to control the ideological and linguistic territory.

Jordan Peterson,"You may say, 'Well, dragons don't exist.' It's, like, yes they do - the category 'predator' and the category 'dragon' are the same category. It absolutely exists. It's a superordinate category. It exists absolutely more than anything else. In fact, it really exists."
,
Jordan Peterson,Men and women aren't the same. And they won't be the same. That doesn't mean that they can't be treated fairly.

Jordan Peterson,I'm interested in what motivates individuals to participate in atrocious acts to support their ideological identification.
,
Jordan Peterson,The masculine spirit is under assault. It's obvious.

Jordan Peterson,It makes sense that a witch lives in a swamp.
,
Jordan Peterson,There's no doubt that inequality destabilizes societies. I think the social science evidence on that front is crystal clear.
,
Jordan Peterson,The idea that women were oppressed throughout history is an appalling theory.
,
Jordan Peterson,"It's a small percentage of people who do the 80-hour-a-week high-powered career thing, and they're almost all men. Why? Well, men are driven by socio-economic status more than women."
,
Jordan Peterson,"You can say, 'Well, isn't it unfortunate that chaos is represented by the feminine' - well, it might be unfortunate, but it doesn't matter, because that is how it's represented. It's been represented like that forever. And there are reasons for it. You can't change it. It's not possible. This is underneath everything."
,
Jordan Peterson,"It's in the best interest of the radical left types - best psychological and strategic interest - to refuse to admit to the possibility that reasonable people can object to their ideological staff. Because if reasonable people objected, that would imply that their ideological stance is not reasonable."
,
Jordan Peterson,'Happiness' is a pointless goal.
,
Jordan Peterson,"To me, ideology is corrupt; it's a parasite on religious structures. To be an ideologue is to have all of the terrible things that are associated with religious certainty and none of the utility. If you're an ideologue, you believe everything that you think. If you're religious, there's a mystery left there."
,
Jordan Peterson,"I have a hard time figuring out what kind of box to put me in, too, because I don't know exactly what's going on around me or why. But I need to stay outside of boxes because then I can look at what's inside of them without being part of them."

Jordan Peterson,"If you learn a martial art, you learn to be dangerous, but simultaneously, you learn to control it."
,
Jordan Peterson,"Life is tragic. You are tiny and flawed and ignorant and weak, and everything else is huge, complex, and overwhelming."
,
Jordan Peterson,"If you're talking to a man who wouldn't fight with you under any circumstances whatsoever, then you're talking to someone for whom you have absolutely no respect."
,
Jordan Peterson,"I'm always surprised when people respond positively to what I am saying, given its seriousnessness and strange nature."
,
Jordan Peterson,"To master a new technology, you have to play with it."
,
Jordan Peterson,I do believe that there are places where the mythological and the literal touch.
,
Jordan Peterson,"All things considered, there's nobody better for children than parents."
,
Jordan Peterson,"Part of the reason there's an injunction to the truth, for example, is that if you're in a circumstance of extreme uncertainty, your best weapon, let's say, or your best tool or your best defense is the truth, because it keeps things simpler."
,
Jordan Peterson,"One of the things I've told men over and over and over and over is if you're being rejected by all the women that you approach, it's not the women!"
,
Jordan Peterson,"There were some great clinicians in the 20th century - great men. Freud was a genius; Jung was a genius, Carl Rogers was a genius - there's a half-dozen psychologists of the 1950s and humanists of the 1960s."
,
Jordan Peterson,You can't go backward in life.
,
Jordan Peterson,"You can't just slander someone, defame them, lie about them. You can't incite people to crime. There's all sorts of reasonable restrictions on free speech that are already codified in the British common-law system."
,
Jordan Peterson,"A properly balanced story provides an equal representation of the negative and positive attributes of, I could say the world, but it's actually a being. 'Harry Potter''s a good example. So Harry's the hero, right. But he's tainted with evil. There's a dark and a light in every bit of that narrative. It's well balanced."
,
Jordan Peterson,You have to listen very carefully and tell the truth if you are going to get a paranoid person to open up to you.
,
Jordan Peterson,"If you're a social scientist worth your salt, you never do a univariate analysis."
,
Jordan Peterson,"That's another hallmark of truth, is that it snaps things together. People write to me all the time and say it's as if things were coming together in my mind. It's like the Platonic idea that all learning was remembering. You have a nature, and when you feel that nature articulated, it's it's like the act of snapping the puzzle pieces together."
,
Jordan Peterson,The answer to the problem of inequality is for the people who are fortunate enough to either have been gifted or deserved more to do everything they can to make the communities around them as strong as they possibly can.
,
Jordan Peterson,"Assuming if there's such a thing as reality, if you have a false relationship with it, how can you do anything but fail?"
,
Jordan Peterson,"You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to."
,
Jordan Peterson,It's not proper for the government to intrude too thoroughly into the domain of the family. It's inappropriate.
,
Jordan Peterson,"People have been fed this diet of pabulum, rights, and impulsive freedom. There's just an absolute starvation for the other side of the story."

Juice Wrld,I think it's important to add a personal aspect to your music - that's what makes it authentic at the end of the day.

Juice Wrld,"My school had a radio show, and when I first decided to become a rapper, I was on there, and I would, like, freestyle."

Kevin Mitnick,"At the end of the day, my goal was to be the best hacker."
,
Kevin Mitnick,To some people I'll always be the bad guy.
,
Kevin Mitnick,The key to social engineering is influencing a person to do something that allows the hacker to gain access to information or your network.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Hackers are breaking the systems for profit. Before, it was about intellectual curiosity and pursuit of knowledge and thrill, and now hacking is big business."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Companies spend millions of dollars on firewalls, encryption, and secure access devices and it's money wasted because none of these measures address the weakest link in the security chain: the people who use, administer, operate and account for computer systems that contain protected information."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"The hacker mindset doesn't actually see what happens on the other side, to the victim."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"A company can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on firewalls, intrusion detection systems and encryption and other security technologies, but if an attacker can call one trusted person within the company, and that person complies, and if the attacker gets in, then all that money spent on technology is essentially wasted."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"I was addicted to hacking, more for the intellectual challenge, the curiosity, the seduction of adventure; not for stealing, or causing damage or writing computer viruses."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"As a young boy, I was taught in high school that hacking was cool."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"I wasn't a hacker for the money, and it wasn't to cause damage."
,
Kevin Mitnick,I saw myself as an electronic joy rider.
,
Kevin Mitnick,You can never protect yourself 100%. What you do is protect yourself as much as possible and mitigate risk to an acceptable degree. You can never remove all risk.
,
Kevin Mitnick,Hackers are becoming more sophisticated in conjuring up new ways to hijack your system by exploiting technical vulnerabilities or human nature. Don't become the next victim of unscrupulous cyberspace intruders.
,
Kevin Mitnick,I characterize myself as a retired hacker. I'm applying what I know to improve security at companies.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Social engineering is using manipulation, influence and deception to get a person, a trusted insider within an organization, to comply with a request, and the request is usually to release information or to perform some sort of action item that benefits that attacker."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Hacking was the only entertainment that would occupy my mind - like a huge video game, but with real consequences. I could have evaded the FBI a lot longer if I had been able to control my passion for hacking."
,
Kevin Mitnick,New security loopholes are constantly popping up because of wireless networking. The cat-and-mouse game between hackers and system administrators is still in full swing.
,
Kevin Mitnick,Should we fear hackers? Intention is at the heart of this discussion.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Hacking is exploiting security controls either in a technical, physical or a human-based element."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Social engineering is using deception, manipulation and influence to convince a human who has access to a computer system to do something, like click on an attachment in an e-mail."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Security is always going to be a cat and mouse game because there'll be people out there that are hunting for the zero day award, you have people that don't have configuration management, don't have vulnerability management, don't have patch management."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"I think it goes back to my high school days. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A."
,
Kevin Mitnick,I'm still a hacker. I get paid for it now. I never received any monetary gain from the hacking I did before. The main difference in what I do now compared to what I did then is that I now do it with authorization.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"For the average home-user, anti-virus software is a must."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Use a personal firewall. Configure it to prevent other computers, networks and sites from connecting to you, and specify which programs are allowed to connect to the net automatically."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"I don't condone anyone causing damage in my name, or doing anything malicious in support of my plight. There are more productive ways to help me. As a hacker myself, I never intentionally damaged anything."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"My hacking involved pretty much exploring computer systems and obtaining access to the source code of telecommunication systems and computer operating systems, because my goal was to learn all I can about security vulnerabilities within these systems."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"No way, no how did I break into NORAD. That's a complete myth. And I never attempted to access anything considered to be classified government systems."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"If you go to a coffee shop or at the airport, and you're using open wireless, I would use a VPN service that you could subscribe for 10 bucks a month. Everything is encrypted in an encryption tunnel, so a hacker cannot tamper with your connection."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Our Constitution requires that the accused be presumed innocent before trial, thus granting all citizens the right to a bail hearing, where the accused has the opportunity to be represented by counsel, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"I use Mac. Not because it's more secure than everything else - because it is actually less secure than Windows - but I use it because it is still under the radar. People who write malicious code want the greatest return on their investment, so they target Windows systems. I still work with Windows in virtual machines."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Then again, my case was all about the misappropriation of source code because I wanted to become the best hacker in the world and I enjoyed beating the security mechanisms."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"People are prone to taking mental shortcuts. They may know that they shouldn't give out certain information, but the fear of not being nice, the fear of appearing ignorant, the fear of a perceived authority figure - all these are triggers, which can be used by a social engineer to convince a person to override established security procedures."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"The first programming assignment I had in high school was to find the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I thought it would be cooler to write a program to get the teacher's password and all the other students' passwords. And the teacher gave me an A and told the class how smart I was."
,
Kevin Mitnick,What I found personally to be true was that it's easier to manipulate people rather than technology.
,
Kevin Mitnick,Anything out there is vulnerable to attack given enough time and resources.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Most people assume that once security software is installed, they're protected. This isn't the case. It's critical that companies be proactive in thinking about security on a long-term basis."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Computer hacking really results in financial losses and hassles. The objectives of terrorist groups are more serious. That is not to say that cyber groups can't access a telephone switch in Manhattan on a day like 9/11, shut it down, and therefore cause more casualties."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"I love solving puzzles, I love finding my way around obstacles, and I love learning new things about technology."
,
Kevin Mitnick,Phone phreaking is a type of hacking that allows you to explore the telephone network by exploiting the phone systems and phone company employees.
,
Kevin Mitnick,I was hooked in before hacking was even illegal.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Once when I was a fugitive, I was working for a law firm in Denver."
,
Kevin Mitnick,A hacker doesn't deliberately destroy data or profit from his activities.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"If I needed to know about a security exploit, I preferred to get the information by accessing the companies' security teams' files, rather than poring over lines of code to find it on my own. It's just more efficient."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"I believe in having each device secured and monitoring each device, rather than just monitoring holistically on the network, and then responding in short enough time for damage control."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Garbage can provide important details for hackers: names, telephone numbers, a company's internal jargon."
,
Kevin Mitnick,Some people think technology has the answers.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"I think malware is a significant threat because the mitigation, like antivirus software, hasn't evolved to a point to really mitigate the risk to a reasonable degree."
,
Kevin Mitnick,I have done a lot to rehabilitate my reputation.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Any type of operating system that I wanted to be able to hack, I basically compromised the source code, copied it over to the university because I didn't have enough space on my 200 megabyte hard drive."
,
Kevin Mitnick,I get hired by companies to hack into their systems and break into their physical facilities to find security holes. Our success rate is 100%; we've always found a hole.
,
Kevin Mitnick,I was an accomplished computer trespasser. I don't consider myself a thief.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Are hackers a threat? The degree of threat presented by any conduct, whether legal or illegal, depends on the actions and intent of the individual and the harm they cause."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"For the average home-user, anti-virus software is a must. A personal firewall such as Zone Alarm and running a program like HFNetcheck, which is a free download for personal users. It checks your system to see if anything needs to be patched. I'd also recommend a program such as SpyCop to periodically check for any spyware on your system."
,
Kevin Mitnick,Not being allowed to use the Internet is kind of like not being allowed to use a telephone.
,
Kevin Mitnick,So the ethic I was taught in school resulted in the path I chose in my life following school.
,
Kevin Mitnick,"Oracle, for example, has even hired people to dumpster dive for information about its competitor, Microsoft. It's not even illegal, because trash isn't covered by data secrecy laws."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"A lot of companies are clueless, because they spend most or all of their security budget on high-tech security like fire walls and biometric authentication - which are important and needed - but then they don't train their people."
,
Kevin Mitnick,"What happens with smaller businesses is that they give in to the misconception that their site is secure because the system administrator deployed standard security products - firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or stronger authentication devices such as time-based tokens or biometric smart cards. But those things can be exploited."

,
Marie Curie,"If I see anything vital around me, it is precisely that spirit of adventure, which seems indestructible and is akin to curiosity."
,
Marie Curie,"All my mind was centered on my studies, which, especially at the beginning, were difficult.

Marie Curie,"The death of my husband, coming immediately after the general knowledge of the discoveries with which his name is associated, was felt by the public, and especially by the scientific circles, to be a national misfortune."
,
Marie Curie,"During the year 1894, Pierre Curie wrote me letters that seem to me admirable in their form. No one of them was very long, for he had the habit of concise expression, but all were written in a spirit of sincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a companion know him as he was."
,
Marie Curie,"During the course of my research, I had had occasion to examine not only simple compounds, salts and oxides, but also a great number of minerals."
,
Marie Curie,"We should not allow it to be believed that all scientific progress can be reduced to mechanisms, machines, gearings, even though such machinery also has its beauty. Neither do I believe that the spirit of adventure runs any risk of disappearing in our world."
,
Marie Curie,"I met Pierre Curie for the first time in the spring of the year 1894... A Polish physicist whom I knew, and who was a great admirer of Pierre Curie, one day invited us together to spend the evening with himself and his wife."
,
Marie Curie,My experiments proved that the radiation of uranium compounds can be measured with precision under determined conditions and that this radiation is an atomic property of the element of uranium.
,
Marie Curie,"The first experiments on the biological properties of radium were successfully made in France, with samples from our laboratory, while my husband was living."
,
Marie Curie,"In chemical terms, radium differs little from barium; the salts of these two elements are isomorphic, while those of radium are usually less soluble than the barium salts."

"
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people."

,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness.

"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

"

"Martin Luther King, Jr.",A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.

,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence.
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both impractical and immoral. I am not unmindful of the fact that violence often brings about momentary results. Nations have frequently won their independence in battle. But in spite of temporary victories, violence never brings permanent peace."

"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

"
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love.
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking. There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions. Nothing pains some people more than having to think."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","The first question which the priest and the Levite asked was: 'If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?' But... the good Samaritan reversed the question: 'If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?'"
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

"
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","I am not interested in power for power's sake, but I'm interested in power that is moral, that is right and that is good."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon, which cuts without wounding and ennobles the man who wields it. It is a sword that heals."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of reality."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",Law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.

"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

"
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.

"
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

"
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal.
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Cowardice asks the question, is it safe? Expediency asks the question, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular? But conscience asks the question, is it right? And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because it is right."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Capitalism does not permit an even flow of economic resources. With this system, a small privileged few are rich beyond conscience, and almost all others are doomed to be poor at some level. That's the way the system works. And since we know that the system will not change the rules, we are going to have to change the system."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

"
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself.
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Nonviolence means avoiding not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. You not only refuse to shoot a man, but you refuse to hate him."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","I just want to do God's will. And he's allowed me to go to the mountain. And I've looked over, and I've seen the promised land! I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land."
,
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the glittering sunlight of life's July and left standing amid the piercing chill of an alpine November.

,
Max Muller,"Yes, now I understood for the first time that my soul was not so poor and empty as it had seemed to me, and that it had been only the sun that was lacking to open all its germs, and buds to the light."
,
Max Muller,It smote me to the heart that I had found no one in all the world who loved me more than all others.
,
Max Muller,"The first pages of memory are like the old family Bible. The first leaves are wholly faded and somewhat soiled with handling. But, when we turn further, and come to the chapters where Adam and Eve were banished from Paradise, then, all begins to grow clear and legible."
,
Max Muller,"Would not the child's heart break in despair when the first cold storm of the world sweeps over it, if the warm sunlight of love from the eyes of mother and father did not shine upon him like the soft reflection of divine light and love?"
,
Max Muller,"That is the returning to God which in reality is never concluded on earth but yet leaves behind in the soul a divine home sickness, which never again ceases."
,
Max Muller,Of these years nought remains in memory but the sad feeling that we have advanced and only grown older.
,
Max Muller,"Thus one memory follows another until the waves dash together over our heads, and a deep sigh swells the breast, which warns us that we have forgotten to breathe in the midst of these pure thoughts."
,
Max Muller,"Every life has its years in which one progresses as on a tedious and dusty street of poplars, without caring to know where he is."
,
Max Muller,"How mankind defers from day to day the best it can do, and the most beautiful things it can enjoy, without thinking that every day may be the last one, and that lost time is lost eternity!"
,
Max Muller,"I was so astonished that another had penetrated so deeply into the secrets of my soul, and that he knew what I did not know myself, that when I recovered from it he had already been long upon the street."
,
Max Muller,Childhood has its secrets and its mysteries; but who can tell or who can explain them!
,
Max Muller,"Whoever knows it also knows that in love there is no More and no Less; but that he who loves can only love with the whole heart, and with the whole soul; with all his strength and with all his will."
,
Max Muller,"I was shortly again at the castle, and the Princess gave me her hand to kiss and then brought her children, the young princes and princesses, and we played together, as if we had known each other for years."
,
Max Muller,"Not far from our house, and opposite the old church with the golden cross, stood a large building, even larger than the church, and having many towers."
,
Max Muller,"And then when all around grows dark, when we feel utterly alone, when all men right and left pass us by and know us not, a forgotten feeling rises in the breast."
,
Max Muller,"I spend my happiest hours in reading Vedantic books. They are to me like the light of the morning, like the pure air of the mountains - so simple, so true, if once understood."

,
Pranab Mukherjee,Trickle-down theories do not address the legitimate aspirations of the poor. We must lift those at the bottom so that poverty is erased from the dictionary of modern India.

India's trade performance in the current year has been robust, surpassing pre-crisis export levels and pre-crisis export growth trends. We have diversified our export baskets and our export destinations."

,
Rajinikanth,To ride two horses at the same time is difficult.

Rajinikanth,It is not right to play politics with education.
,
Rajinikanth,"Everyone's amazed by the question that how did I succeed as an actor in the industry, which has Kamal Haasan? It's because I grew as an actor watching Kamal's acting."

,
Rajinikanth,"Starting with a meagre amount of Rs 300 as a conductor, when I became an actor and started seeing huge moneys like Rs 3 or 4 lakhs, I thought I was 'an exclusive creation' by God, and he had made me like this. Later, I got the wisdom and realised that my time was good and things worked out! And I was also a normal human being like others."
,
Rajinikanth,I am drawn towards the power of spirituality and derive a lot of energy from it.

Ramana Maharshi,No one succeeds without effort... Those who succeed owe their success to perseverance.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"

"
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Let come what comes, let go what goes. See what remains."
,
Ramana Maharshi,The degree of freedom from unwanted thoughts and the degree of concentration on a single thought are the measures to gauge spiritual progress.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Time is only an idea. There is only the Reality. Whatever you think it is, it looks like that. If you call it time, it is time. If you call it existence, it is existence, and so on. After calling it time, you divide it into days and nights, months, years, hours, minutes, etc. Time is immaterial for the Path of Knowledge."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Who am I? Not the body, because it is decaying; not the mind, because the brain will decay with the body; not the personality, nor the emotions, for these also will vanish with death."
,
Ramana Maharshi,Our own self-realization is the greatest service we can render the world.
,
Ramana Maharshi,Mind is consciousness which has put on limitations. You are originally unlimited and perfect. Later you take on limitations and become the mind.
,
Ramana Maharshi,Silence is also conversation.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"All bad qualities centre round the ego. When the ego is gone, Realisation results by itself. There are neither good nor bad qualities in the Self. The Self is free from all qualities. Qualities pertain to the mind only."
,
Ramana Maharshi,Self-reform automatically brings about social reform.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"It is the Higher Power which does everything, and the man is only a tool. If he accepts that position, he is free from troubles; otherwise, he courts them."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"The body dies, but the spirit that transcends it cannot be touched by death."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"The greatest error of a man is to think that he is weak by nature, evil by nature. Every man is divine and strong in his real nature. What are weak and evil are his habits, his desires and thoughts, but not himself."
,
Ramana Maharshi,There is no doubt whatsoever that the universe is the merest illusion.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"The Real is ever-present, like the screen on which the cinematographic pictures move. While the picture appears on it, the screen remains invisible. Stop the picture, and the screen will become clear. All thoughts and events are merely pictures moving on the screen of Pure Consciousness, which alone is real."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"When there are thoughts, it is distraction: when there are no thoughts, it is meditation."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Without understanding yourself, what is the use of trying to understand the world?"
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Time and space always change, but there is something which is eternal and changeless. For example, the world and time, past or future, nothing exists for us in sleep. But we exist. Let us try to find out that which is changeless and which always exists."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Think of God; attachments will gradually drop away. If you wait till all desires disappear before starting your devotion and prayer, you will have to wait for a very long time indeed."
,
Ramana Maharshi,Silence is ever speaking; it is the perennial flow of language.
,
Ramana Maharshi,One must realise his Self in order to open the store of unalloyed happiness.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Experiences such as, 'I went; I came; I was; I did,' come naturally to everyone. From these experiences, does it not appear that the consciousness 'I' is the subject of those various acts? Enquiry into the true nature of that consciousness, and remaining as oneself, is the way to understand, through enquiry, one's true nature."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"There is no doubt that breath control is the means for mind control because the mind, like breath, is a part of air; because the nature of mobility is common to both; because the place of origin is the same for both; and because when one of them is controlled, the other gets controlled."
,
Ramana Maharshi,Suffering turns men towards their creator.
,
Ramana Maharshi,I have never said that there is no need for a guru. All depends on what you call guru. He need not be in a human form.
,
Ramana Maharshi,Consciousness is indeed always with us. Everyone knows 'I am!' No one can deny his own being.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"That which comes and goes, rises and sets, is born and dies is the ego. That which always abides, never changes, and is devoid of qualities is the Self."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"I am not the perishable body, but the eternal Self."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"You need not aspire for or get any new state. Get rid of your present thoughts, that is all."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"If there is anything besides the Self there is reason to fear? Who sees the second? First, the ego arises and sees objects as external. If the ego does not rise, the Self alone exists and there is no second."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"If you are vigilant and make a stern effort to reject every thought when it rises, you will soon find that you are going deeper and deeper into your own inner self, where there is no need for your effort to reject the thoughts."
,
Ramana Maharshi,God has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to Him.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Doubts never end. If one doubt is removed, another takes its place. It is like removing the leaves of a tree one by one. Even if all the leaves are clipped off, new ones grow. The tree itself must be uprooted."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"For those who have obtained unobstructed knowledge of Self, the world is seen merely as a bondage causing imagination."
,
Ramana Maharshi,The best way to meditate is through meditation itself.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Like the practice of breath control, meditation on the forms of God, repetition of mantras, food restrictions, etc., are but aids for rendering the mind quiescent."
,
Ramana Maharshi,It is every intelligent man's experience that evildoing recoils on the doer sooner or later.
,
Ramana Maharshi,All activities and events that a body is to go through are determined at the time of conception.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"The mind itself is of the form of all, i.e., of soul, God and world; when it becomes of the form of the Self through knowledge, there is release, which is of the nature of Brahman: this is the teaching."
,
Ramana Maharshi,Devotion complete culminates in knowledge supreme.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Every moment there is creation, every moment destruction. There is no absolute creation, no absolute destruction. Both are movement, and that is eternal."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Society is the body; individuals are its members, its limbs. Just as the various limbs help and co-operate with one another and thus are happy, so each must unite with others in being helpful to all in thought, speech and action... One may see to the good of one's own group, i.e., the group that is immediate to him, and then proceed to others."
,
Ramana Maharshi,Actions yield result by the ordinance of God as He wills.
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Concentration of the mind is in a way common to both Knowledge and Yoga. Yoga aims at union of the individual with the universal, the Reality. This Reality cannot be new. It must exist even now, and it does exist."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"The Self is self-luminous without darkness and light, and is the reality which is self-manifest. Therefore, one should not think of it as this or as that. The very thought of thinking will end in bondage."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"As instruments for knowing the objects, the sense organs are outside, and so they are called outer senses; and the mind is called the inner sense because it is inside. But the distinction between inner and outer is only with reference to the body; in truth, there is neither inner nor outer. The mind's nature is to remain pure like ether."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Even the structure of the atom has been found by the mind. Therefore the mind is subtler than the atom. That which is behind the mind, namely the individual soul, is subtler than the mind."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"Even as one and the same person is called by different names according to the different functions he performs, so also one and the same mind is called by the different names: mind, intellect, memory, and egoity, on account of the difference in the modes - and not because of any real difference."
,
Ramana Maharshi,"The means that make one qualified for enquiry are meditation, yoga, etc. One should gain proficiency in these through graded practice and thus secure a stream of mental modes that is natural and helpful."

Saint Ambrose,A kindness received should be returned with a freer hand.

Stephen Hawking,"I am just a child who has never grown up. I still keep asking these 'how' and 'why' questions. Occasionally, I find an answer."

Stephen Hawking,"A few years ago, the city council of Monza, Italy, barred pet owners from keeping goldfish in curved bowls... saying that it is cruel to keep a fish in a bowl with curved sides because, gazing out, the fish would have a distorted view of reality.

Stephen Hawking,We should seek the greatest value of our action.

Stephen Hawking,We think we have solved the mystery of creation. Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence.

Stephen Hawking,"So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?"

Steve Jobs,"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition."
,
Steve Jobs,"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."
,
Steve Jobs,"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."

Steve Jobs,Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people.

Steve Jobs,Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.
,
Steve Jobs,"For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'No' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."

Steve Jobs,"Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them."
,
Steve Jobs,"

"
,
Steve Jobs,"Stay hungry, stay foolish."
,
Steve Jobs,"No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new."
,
Steve Jobs,"That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."

Steve Jobs,Everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those moments when we are influencing the future.

Steve Jobs,"I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years, Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees."
,
Steve Jobs,"I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life."
,
Steve Jobs,"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things."

Steve Jobs,"An iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator... these are NOT three separate devices! And we are calling it iPhone! Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone. And here it is."

Steve Jobs,"Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn."
,
Steve Jobs,"It's not the tools that you have faith in - tools are just tools. They work, or they don't work. It's people you have faith in or not. Yeah, sure, I'm still optimistic I mean, I get pessimistic sometimes but not for long."
,
Steve Jobs,"Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters to me."
,
Steve Jobs,We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them.
,
Steve Jobs,"If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on."
,
Steve Jobs,My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.
,
Steve Jobs,"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important."
,
Steve Jobs,"A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have."
,
Steve Jobs,"Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works."
,
Steve Jobs,"

"
,
Steve Jobs,Things don't have to change the world to be important.
,
Steve Jobs,"

"
,
Steve Jobs,I believe life is an intelligent thing: that things aren't random.
,
Steve Jobs,"We don't get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? So this is what we've chosen to do with our life."
,
Steve Jobs,"Innovation has nothing to do with how many R & D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R & D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it."
,
Steve Jobs,"When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You'll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back."
,
Steve Jobs,"A lot of companies have chosen to downsize, and maybe that was the right thing for them. We chose a different path. Our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets."
,
Steve Jobs,The reason that Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we've always tried to be at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts.
,
Steve Jobs,"

"
,
Steve Jobs,"Older people sit down and ask, 'What is it?' but the boy asks, 'What can I do with it?'."
,
Steve Jobs,"What is Apple, after all? Apple is about people who think 'outside the box,' people who want to use computers to help them change the world, to help them create things that make a difference, and not just to get a job done."
,
Steve Jobs,Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.
,
Steve Jobs,"I'm an optimist in the sense that I believe humans are noble and honorable, and some of them are really smart. I have a very optimistic view of individuals."
,
Steve Jobs,"Who wants a stylus. You have to get em and put em away, and you lose em. Yuck. Nobody wants a stylus."
,
Steve Jobs,"The system is that there is no system. That doesn't mean we don't have process. Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes. But that's not what it's about. Process makes you more efficient."
,
Steve Jobs,If you're gonna make connections which are innovative... you have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does.
,
Steve Jobs,"

"
,
Steve Jobs,"Our goal is to make the best devices in the world, not to be the biggest."
,
Steve Jobs,"I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when I was 23 and the way I handled that."
,
Steve Jobs,"For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through."
,
Steve Jobs,"Pretty much, Apple and Dell are the only ones in this industry making money. They make it by being Wal-Mart. We make it by innovation."
,
Steve Jobs,"The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it. But it's like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out. They eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment."
,
Steve Jobs,"When you're young, you look at television and think, there's a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that's not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want."
,
Steve Jobs,My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept each others' negative tendencies in check; they balanced each other. And the total was greater than the sum of the parts.
,
Steve Jobs,"And it comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We're always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it's only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important."
,
Steve Jobs,"

"
,
Steve Jobs,We're just enthusiastic about what we do.
,
Steve Jobs,I think we're having fun. I think our customers really like our products. And we're always trying to do better.
,
Steve Jobs,"As individuals, people are inherently good. I have a somewhat more pessimistic view of people in groups. And I remain extremely concerned when I see what's happening in our country, which is in many ways the luckiest place in the world. We don't seem to be excited about making our country a better place for our kids."
,
Steve Jobs,"But innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10:30 at night with a new idea, or because they realized something that shoots holes in how we've been thinking about a problem."
,
Steve Jobs,"First was the mouse. The second was the click wheel. And now, we're going to bring multi-touch to the market. And each of these revolutionary interfaces has made possible a revolutionary product - the Mac, the iPod and now the iPhone."

Suga,"

"
,
Suga,Every moment is memorable to me.
,
Suga,"I think there's a lot of different kinds of love: not just between a boyfriend and girlfriend, but love with your family, love with the people around you. I think that's really important and, I think, would really be a good thing for the world and make a better world for everybody."
,
Suga,"'Spring Day' - I wrote main lyrics based on my personal experience with old friends. It is about my sad memories with him, and it makes me sentimental whenever I listen to the song."
,
Suga,I want to be on the Billboard Hot 100 with a single that has Korean lyrics.
,
Suga,"In general, what fans talk about and think about become a very important source of inspiration to us, because we want to write something that's real to people, especially those who listen to BTS music."
,
Suga,Fashion tells about who you are from external point of view.
,
Suga,I want people to get positive energy from our music.
,
Suga,I try not to be influenced by success or popularity.
,
Suga,I prefer comfortable clothes in daily life.
,
Suga,I think BTS is able to shine because we have fans.
,
Suga,To make the Billboard Hot 100 is my dream.
,
Suga,I'm pretty much open to anyone who's unique and has mutual appreciation in the music as BTS.
,
Suga,Good music will always be recognized in the end.
,
Suga,We will come back with even better music and concepts to be able to say goodbye to 'The Most Beautiful Moment in Life' beautifully.
,
Suga,Music and fashion have to have their own styles. It's a must.
,
Suga,"I arranged 'DT Suga,' which I previously used in lyrics, backwards. 'DT' is D Town and refers to my hometown. I like the meaning, and it sounds cool when I say it, so I think I'll continue using this name when I work externally. I also like how the mixtape came out in August."
,
Suga,"From now on, we want to put on even cooler performances, be cooler, be better, so look forward to it. Please, always look forward to it."
,
Suga,"In addition to being what we are as BTS, we wanted to bring some changes, and we actually wanted to evolve as a group. We wanted to show our many colors, but we still want to console others and give hope to others."
,
Suga,We believe that we'll get what we want if we continue to be BTS and know what to do as artists and performers with passion.
,
Suga,"My biggest worry is that we have to keep making good music, and I want to do well, but I wonder if I will be able to."
,
Suga,"There are people who think negatively, and there have been people who react negatively towards BTS music."
,
Suga,"I have some tracks and songs written for future collaboration, and I'm happy to work with artists who have the right voice and taste."
,
Suga,"Worldwide, our young generation shares the same issues socially and politically."
,
Suga,I think we always have to put forth music that's better than the last.
,
Suga,"No matter what, our American Army is so big, and we are so very thankful to them."
,
Suga,"I first paid attention to fashion when I was around 15, but I don't really care much about it these days."

Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.
,
Sun Tzu,To fight and conquer in all our battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."
,
Sun Tzu,"If fighting is sure to result in victory, than you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding."
,
Sun Tzu,"All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved."
,
Sun Tzu,"Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent's fate."
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,"Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories."
,
Sun Tzu,"The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable."
,
Sun Tzu,"Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death."
,
Sun Tzu,"Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and you know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and you know Earth, you may make your victory complete."
,
Sun Tzu,For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,"Thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy."
,
Sun Tzu,"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory."
,
Sun Tzu,The general who wins the battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance.
,
Sun Tzu,The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.
,
Sun Tzu,"The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom."
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.
,
Sun Tzu,"The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected."
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,"If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain to be in peril."
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,"He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot, will be victorious."
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,Quickness is the essence of the war.
,
Sun Tzu,"The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."
,
Sun Tzu,"Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a deadly situation, and they will then live. When people fall into danger, they are then able to strive for victory."
,
Sun Tzu,Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer the enemy whenever they move and their achievements surpass those of ordinary men is foreknowledge.
,
Sun Tzu,"The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,"He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will be victorious."
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,"If your opponent is of choleric temper, irritate him."
,
Sun Tzu,To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
,
Sun Tzu,Secret operations are essential in war; upon them the army relies to make its every move.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,"If you are far from the enemy, make him believe you are near."
,
Sun Tzu,"When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce."
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
,
Sun Tzu,There has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefited.
,
Sun Tzu,It is essential to seek out enemy agents who have come to conduct espionage against you and to bribe them to serve you. Give them instructions and care for them. Thus doubled agents are recruited and used.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,Balk the enemy's power; force him to reveal himself.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,A good commander is benevolent and unconcerned with fame.
,
Sun Tzu,"If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity."
,
Sun Tzu,"The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution."
,
Sun Tzu,"Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared."
,
Sun Tzu,"In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good."
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
,
Sun Tzu,"

"
,
Sun Tzu,Victory usually goes to the army who has better trained officers and men.
,
Sun Tzu,Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
,
Sun Tzu,He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
,
Sun Tzu,"For them to perceive the advantage of defeating the enemy, they must also have their rewards."
,
Sun Tzu,"It is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for the purposes of spying, and thereby they achieve great results."
,
Sun Tzu,Of all those in the army close to the commander none is more intimate than the secret agent; of all rewards none more liberal than those given to secret agents; of all matters none is more confidential than those relating to secret operations.
,
Sun Tzu,"If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory."

Sushant Singh Rajput,"No matter what you achieve, what you want to aspire to be, or how famous and powerful you become, the most important thing is whether you are excited about each and every moment of your life because of your work and people around you."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"We should never forget the inevitable, as we will lose everything eventually. So, why fret over any kind of security? The idea is to just fly and experience it all while it lasts."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"What keeps me going are my learnings, which I would rather call my 'experience,' and my urge to explore."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I think people generally are lost, as they keep thinking about what is going to happen and what they have done. They are not alive anymore. The art of listening is missing. In their head, they are doing something else."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"The more I learn about things, I realise how wrong I was before."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"Instead of sounding pretentious, phony, or repetitive, I'd rather not speak."

Sushant Singh Rajput,"Everybody is in a hurry to decode you in a certain way, and then they expect you to adhere to their definition. How can they possibly do that when you yourself are finding it hard to discover yourself?"
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I pray to God every day that he makes me the biggest superstar, but before that, I ask God to make me a good actor. Being a star is hard, but being an actor is even harder. I want to be both before I am done."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"Whatever dream you have, be sure that it is going to be happen, and then forget about it. Then you have to come back to the present and be there 100 percent."

Sushant Singh Rajput,I've stopped taking myself seriously because now I understand how fickle my thoughts are.

Sushant Singh Rajput,"The closest synonym of happiness is excitement, and you can generate it by doing something that you can't completely comprehend. This understanding makes the process rich and exciting."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"Practical knowledge of what works and what doesn't work is much better. Theoretical knowledge is important, but I think practical knowledge works better."

,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"The best thing is to accept the circumstances, not take them personally, deal with them, stop complaining, and give everything your best."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,My strength would be my honesty and my passion towards my work.
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I have seen extreme lows because of factors that were not in my hands - be it not having money to buy my first bike, dropping out of a prestigious engineering college without having a single rupee in my bank account, living with seven boys in a single-room kitchen in Mumbai, or eating nothing but khichdi every day. But I cherish all those moments."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I might not be over-enthusiastic about socialising and making friends, but I am not a loner. I love hanging out with my friends, and I do it often when I am not working. Maybe, since I am not often invited to the 'happening' parties of our industry, where the media is around, I have earned the reputation of being a loner."

Sushant Singh Rajput,"I have made a lot of mistakes, but I am proud of them all."

Sushant Singh Rajput,"A man should definitely own a couple of blue denims, white crew neck T-shirt, a versatile blazer, comfortable pair of boxers, and coloured sneakers."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I think we are all insecure, and there is nothing wrong in accepting that. But the problem arises when we try to counter this insecurity by cultivating this illusion of control, and we start taking ourselves and everything we know too seriously."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"Money was a big differentiator when I was growing up, but I made sure it doesn't stay that way."

,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"If you are seeing something for the first time, one of your first reactions should be fascination."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I really wanted to buy a Range Rover. It was a big dream, and the day I bought it, I was very happy, but by evening, I was immune to it. That's when I realized that excitement, if it's happiness, is not in reaching the goal but in the process. Thus process trumps over realization."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,I was the youngest child and the only son. I was expected to shine in academics. It seemed like too big a risk to take up cricket as a career. I thought I had to live up to my family's expectations. So I chose to be an engineer.
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,I will continue doing things irrespective of the medium as long as I'm excited about it.
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I realised quite early that by the time I articulate my thoughts into words, I'm on to another thought. And what comes out wasn't what I thought of exactly. So not talking was a better option."

Sushant Singh Rajput,"Since I think I am very boring in normal life, I tend to hide behind all these exciting characters, making people believe that I am someone else entirely. That feeling is very powerful."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I have songs that define characters from each film of mine. It can be a song from that particular film or something that just goes with the wavelength of the film; you listen to it, and it gives you that rhythm. I can't articulate how it helps, but it somehow gives you an understanding of the character."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"As an actor, you think you know your craft, you know the conflicts in your character, but often you don't."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"There are so many ways to approach a character. You have to figure out the similarities between you and the character, build on them, and at the same time, blur the dissimilarities. Since you do it day in and day out, it becomes a process and a part of you."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"It took me 13 months just to prepare for 'M.S. Dhoni'... I started by watching every single video I could find of his, repeatedly. After three months, people who met me started saying that they could see similarities, and I knew I was on the right path."

,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I have been blessed with strong leg muscles, and dancing really exercises one's legs."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"Things are difficult for outsiders in the industry, and it is very evident, too. It does not mean that insiders have it easy or that it's impossible for outsiders to break in. More often than not, the difference is about how successes and failures are viewed and magnified."

,
Sushant Singh Rajput,I never think about what people will think when they watch me on screen.
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"The equation I share with the camera doesn't change whether you place a camera in front of me or a live audience. Just the pay cheques differ. But that doesn't matter to me because I've so much money, I don't even think about it. It's just lying there."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"Our job, as actors, is not to tell the audience how interesting we are, but to entertain them with our films."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"When I am in front of the camera or on stage, I am not me."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"Bringing out your vulnerable side and shedding your privacy in front of complete strangers is so very difficult, but when you are into the performance, the relief and release is so extraordinary that you get addicted."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,I remember when the results of the All India Engineering exams came out. I ranked 7th. I even got a scholarship. But it was during the sixth semester of my engineering course that I decided to call it quits and pursue acting seriously.
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"I was a studious child, heavily into academics. For the longest time, I wouldn't talk."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"What people think of me doesn't affect me. As bizarre as it sounds, I don't have a Google alert on my phone; I don't read newspapers, and I don't watch television. If something important happens, I will get to know about it."
,
Sushant Singh Rajput,"Four days a week, I do gymming, four days marital arts. Once a week I normally play lawn tennis, and once a week I horseride."

Sushant Singh Rajput,"I have four elder sisters, and being the youngest, I was pampered."

Yuvraj Singh,"Beating cancer is personal battle. It was one of the toughest opponents I have faced so far, and I think I did reasonably well. Touch wood."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Relationships survive on trust, and if that is broken at any point, it's pretty much the end of the relationship. Besides, inability to communicate leads to problems."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Being the vice-captain, you see a lot of things on the field. You have to try and help the captain as much as you can and lead by example on the field. Small things like getting a run-out or taking a catch makes the other boys try and lift their standards. So yes, I do have an important role, even if I'm not captain."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I am a great movie buff, and I devour films regularly."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"The bad boy image is something given to me by the media. I have been in relationships earlier, even for as long as three years. I am not saying I am a saint. I am like any other guy, I guess. Unfortunately, every time I even meet a person, it is reported as a link-up."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"There were times when chemo would eat my body, but I told myself that I have the strength and courage to win and come out stronger."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I have worked really hard on my game, but I think my mother has been a real pillar of strength. She has prayed a lot, sacrificed a lot for me. You know, she hasn't seen me bat so far. When I am batting, she is praying... mothers are like that, aren't they?"
,
Yuvraj Singh,I want someone who will love me for the person I am and not because of my status. It has to be someone who understands the pressure of playing for India. It will be very difficult to be with a person who has her own career because someone has to make sacrifices for the family and house.
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Cricket is my life. Before the cancer, I was happy-go-lucky. I used to think about my career and worry about the future. But post it, my thinking has completely changed. I'm happy to eat and breathe normally. I'm happy to have my life back."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"When one is young, aspiring to play for the country, doing well, any hindrance, like injury or being out of form, can be frustrating and a cause of annoyance or even anger. But once you have a close encounter with death, you realise the real value of life."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"From a spectator point of view, Test cricket is not important; people hardly watch Test cricket. But as a player, Tests are the real thing. You have to concentrate for five days. It's a lot of time, and not easy to do it day in and day out. If people have played 70-100 Tests, it's a lot of cricket, a lot of concentration and dedication."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I cried like a baby. When no one could see me or hear me. Not because I feared what cancer would do, but because I didn't want the disease. I wanted my life to be normal, which it could no longer be."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Obviously, a lot of things play on your mind when you're batting. This might happen and this might not. The best thing you can do when you're batting is not to think too much, and wait for the next ball."
,
Yuvraj Singh,I have been accused of things that I have never done. I have been called a perpetrator of incidents while I was actually a peacemaker. I really don't know why. Yuvraj Singh isn't a party animal; he is just singled out. I don't know why.
,
Yuvraj Singh,"The battle against cancer has made me strong. It's like winning a war! When I was diagnosed, I was told by doctors my kidney, liver and other organs could fail. It was tough. I didn't know if I could save my life. But I was positive, and because of that, the doctor told me that I would be a man who would never have cancer."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"In sport, there is always room for improvement. Whenever I see my innings against the West Indies or Australia, I think, 'Maybe, I could have done this better or should have changed that.' See, cricket is a skill game, and one can always improve upon the impact one has on an innings."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"Cancer has taught me a lot of things. Maybe it is the best thing that has happened to me. I can't say right now, but maybe some years down the line, I would realise. When I was taking chemotherapy, there were a lot of elderly patients, and that would inspire me. I thought, 'If they can be cured, why can't I be?'"
,
Yuvraj Singh,"When I was going through my chemotherapy, I realized not many people are willing to talk about cancer, even after getting fully cured. Celebrities and educated people are also very protective and private about it. I still haven't understood why. I decided to fight my battle out in the public."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"No matter what people say, about what I did, about what I am like... They say you are not dedicated or hardworking. A lot of people say things about me, but they don't realise I have played 250 games. It's not like you just land up in the team, sit down and play 250 games. You can't survive like that in international cricket."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I have stopped having goals. If you have many goals, and you don't reach your goals, it is very upsetting, so I just think of keeping it simple, working hard and going and playing the game. But I know there are going to be very important series for Indian cricket. I will just try my best to be in my fittest form."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"People who don't know me, how will they know what I am really like? They will only see me on the field, only see me in an advertisement. People who know what kind of a guy I am will tell you I'm a very open person."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"On the field, you have to be aggressive; you're thinking how to get the better of a situation. It's not that I don't laugh on the field. In fact, I think it's very important to laugh, especially when you are angry and aggressive, to just take the tension away, make the moment go away."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I have been in love, and it was a great feeling. It's when you are attracted to and feel affection for someone. You want to do things for that person. But only love isn't enough in a relationship - understanding and communication are very important aspects."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I'm past my wooing days now. See, I am an honest person. If I like a girl, I will go and tell her."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"When I was a kid, I used to try and hit every ball out of the ground. After playing one-day cricket and Test cricket, I never thought I'd get a chance to play like that again, ever. Twenty20 has given me the opportunity of playing like a kid again. I can just feel free and go out there and hit."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I will only think of settling down after Salman Khan, the other most eligible bachelor, plans to settle down. We are eligible bachelors, but he's the rock star, so let him get married first; then I'll think about myself."
,
Yuvraj Singh,"I didn't believe when I was first told that I have cancer. I thought, 'How can a young person like me get cancer?' I thought it could never happen to me. It took me a while to realise that I was diagnosed with cancer."
